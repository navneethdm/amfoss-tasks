# amfoss-tasks
I, Navneeth Dinukumar Menon, am a first-year BTech Computer Science (AI) undergrad at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. I know beginner-level coding, a bit of Python and C. I can put quite an effort into what I do, provided I am really interested in it. 

# Why should we choose you?
I have used my free time to do the Praveshan tasks and also tried to regularly upload the daily updates. I have attended all the weekly meetings too. I have learned quite a bit and am interested in learning even more and not being limited to just what's taught in class. I am sure that if appointed, I will try my best to be a valuable asset to the club and put in the work required. 

# How do you intend to contribute back to the club?
I am willing to spend my free time learning more and being my best for the club. I have heard about club students staying back after classes and spending their time learning things taught in class and for the club, and I am willing to do so. I don't consider myself a person who quits very easily, and hence, I am ready to put in the effort needed without taking it as a burden because I am genuinely interested in this. 

# What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?
My field of interest is computers and AI, and I coincidentally got allocated to the same branch. When it comes to computers, my interests lie in web development and ethical hacking. I haven't learned much about either of these on my own, but I hope to do so during these years. Obviously, clubs will play a major role in understanding these topics, and hence my interest in joining the clubs. 

# What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?
Even though I haven't completed all of the tasks, I learned a lot doing the tasks that I did do. The tasks have been truly amazing.  Although I hope to be selected, I’m not completely disheartened if it doesn’t go that way, as the lessons I’ve learned throughout the process are incredibly valuable. I do feel a bit sad that I wasn’t able to complete all 10 tasks, despite giving my very best effort on each one.
